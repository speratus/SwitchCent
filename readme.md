# SwitchCent
SwitchCent is a tiny currency conversion tool. Select a base currency, input an amount and SwitchCent will tell you how much
money that amount would translate to in your target currency.

The idea behind this is to get a rough estimate of how much a currency changer is charging you to change from the base to the target.
All currency changers take some amount of money from you to make money, but some take more than others. 

SwitchCent is designed to help you figure out where the best money changing deals are, or for those just curious about how far a 
certain amount of money would get them in another country.
